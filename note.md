What are AI agents?

Regular prompting experience ( llm's -> human in the loop -> llm's -> human in the loop -> final output) 

LLM's predict the next most likely token (create content), but when they can imply on a kind of cognition and reasonably react. For example, they can choose between a and b, because they can put together words in a certain way where they can compare.

An AI agent is an autonomous system that uses an LLM to make decisions and control application flow. True agency emerges when the LLM can engage in self-directed reasoningâ€”asking questions, generating answers, and refining its thinking without external intervention. An agent demonstrates autonomy by working through a series of logical steps, evaluating options, and optimizing outputs beyond what would be possible with a single prompt. In CrewAI's framework, these agents take on specialized roles with defined goals and expertise, enabling collaborative problem-solving through dynamic task delegation.
